## üéØ Why Use This Tool?

Ever received a Jupyter notebook as an HTML file from a course instructor or colleague? Converting it back to an editable `.ipynb` file can be a hassle. This app simplifies the process, enabling you to:

- **Edit Assignments**: Convert static HTML handouts into editable Jupyter notebooks for coursework.
- **Recover Notebooks**: Restore `.ipynb` files from HTML exports for further analysis or modification.
- **Streamline Workflows**: Save time by automating the conversion process with a clean, web-based interface.

Whether you're a data science student tackling NumPy assignments or a professional reviving old notebook exports, this tool is your go-to solution!

## üõ† Installation (Local Setup)

Follow these steps to run the app locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/jupyter-html-converter.git
   cd jupyter-html-converter
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   The `requirements.txt` includes:
   ```
   streamlit==1.31.0
   beautifulsoup4==4.12.3
   lxml==5.2.2
   ```

4. **Run the App**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. **Access the App**:
   Open your browser to `http://localhost:8501` and upload your Jupyter HTML file!

## üìñ Usage

1. **Launch the App**:
   - Run locally or access the deployed version on Streamlit Community Cloud.
   
2. **Upload HTML File**:
   - Click the file uploader and select a JupyterLab-exported `.html` or `.htm` file.
   - Ensure the file is a valid JupyterLab HTML export containing `jp-Cell` divs.

3. **Download .ipynb**:
   - After uploading, the app processes the file and offers a download button.
   - The downloaded `.ipynb` file will have the same name as the uploaded file (e.g., `numpy_lesson.html` ‚Üí `numpy_lesson.ipynb`).

4. **Open in Jupyter**:
   - Save the downloaded `.ipynb` file and open it in JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook.
   - Note: If the notebook contains images (e.g., `list.png`), ensure those files are in the same directory as the `.ipynb` file.

1. **Push to GitHub**:
   - Create a public GitHub repository (e.g., `jupyter-html-converter`).
   - Add the following files:
     ```
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
     ```
   - Push to GitHub:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Initial commit for Streamlit app"
     git push origin main
     ```

2. **Deploy on Streamlit**:
   - Log in to [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io).
   - Click ‚ÄúNew app‚Äù and select your GitHub repository.
   - Set the main file path to `app.py` and deploy.
   - Your app will be live at a URL like `https://your-app-name.streamlit.app`.

3. **Update Automatically**:
   - Any changes pushed to your GitHub repository‚Äôs main branch will trigger automatic redeployment.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Example Input/Output

**Input HTML** (JupyterLab-exported):
```html
<div class="jp-Cell jp-MarkdownCell">
  <div class="jp-RenderedMarkdown">
    <h1>NumPy</h1>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="jp-Cell jp-CodeCell">
  <div class="jp-CodeMirrorEditor">
    <pre>import numpy as np</pre>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Output .ipynb**:
```json
{
  "cells": [
    {
      "cell_type": "markdown",
      "metadata": {},
      "source": ["<h1>NumPy</h1>"]
    },
    {
      "cell_type": "code",
      "execution_count": null,
      "metadata": {},
      "source": ["import numpy as np"],
      "outputs": []
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {...},
  "nbformat": 4,
  "nbformat_minor": 5
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes & Limitations

- **Image Files**: The app converts `<img>` tags to markdown syntax (e.g., `![Image](list.png)`). Ensure referenced image files are available in your Jupyter working directory.
- **Outputs**: Currently, code cell outputs are not extracted (set to `[]`). If your HTML includes outputs (e.g., in `jp-OutputArea`), contact the developer for an enhanced version.
- **File Size**: For large HTML files, consider adding a size limit (e.g., 10MB) to avoid memory issues on Streamlit Cloud.
- **Compatibility**: Optimized for JupyterLab HTML exports. Older Jupyter Notebook formats may require adjustments.
